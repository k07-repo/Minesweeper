# Minesweeper

Recreation of Minesweeper (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)) in Java using Java Swing.

Gameplay should be identical to older versions of Windows Minesweeper, with some option changes such as a configurable number of "second chance" lifelines and weaker custom game restrictions. Options are saved by being serialized to the game's directory.

The sounds used in this project are edited public domain sounds. The images are from Windows XP Minesweeper.

The JAR executable can be downloaded in the "Releases" section of this repository.
